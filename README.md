Tik Tak Toe / M.I.T Full Stack Web Development Assignment

# Roadmap of Future Improvements
<b>I would like to make a few changes to the existing look and functionality of this project. </b> <br><br>
1.) I would like to change the style of it completely.  By maybe adding a main background image of the page to be a picture of earth and all 8 tiles also with their own backgrounds of the other 8 planets(including Pluto) in our solar system.  Turning it into a cosmic Tik Tak Toe board game.<br><br>
2.) I would also like to increase the size of the X & O typefaces.  By maybe even having an image that will overlay once clicked that will be a space shuttle X or space shuttle O that will go along with the Cosmic theme board.  With an announcement of which space Shuttle saved our solor system. LOL<br><br>
3.) I would also like to create a game reset button, which will start a new game.
