Tik Tak Toe / M.I.T Full Stack Web Development Assignment

# Roadmap of Future Improvements
I would like to make a few changes to the existing look and functionality of this project.  <br>
1.) I would like to change the style of it completely.  By maybe main background of the page to be a picture of earth and all 8 tiles having backgrounds of the other 8 planets(including Pluto) in our solar system.  Turning it into a cosmic Tik Tak Toe game.<br>
2.) I would also like to increase the size of the X & O.  Or maybe have an image that will overlay that will be a space shuttle X or O that will go along with the Cosmic theme board.<br>
3.) I would also like to create a game reset button, which will start a new game.
